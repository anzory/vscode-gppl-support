## Requirements

There are no dependencies in this extension, but I highly recommend using:

- nice extension [coenraads.bracket-pair-colorizer-2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2)

- [JetBrains Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/JetBrains+Mono?preview.text_type=custom) font Designed by JetBrains, Philipp Nurullin, Konstantin Bulenkov

## Extension Settings

There are one settings in this extension: set `Enable Preview From Code Navigation` to `true`

![settings](https://github.com/anzory/vscode-gppl-support/blob/master/images/screens/settings.png?raw=true)

This will change the behavior when the `Go To Definition` opens in a new tab every time

## Extension Settings

There are a few settings for this extension:

(File -> Preferenses -> Settins -> Extensions)

- `Editor: Default Formatter`: you must specify _'anzory.vscode-gppl-support'_ to be able to format GPPL documents (by default)
- `Format: Enable`: specifies whether or not the document can be formatted

- `Format On Save`: defines whether or not the document will be formatted when it is saved

## Release Notes

### 1.7.10

### Update

- to the latest versions of VSCode and other libraries

## Plan to implement

It is a good text editor with GPPL language support for SolidCAM postprocessor editing at the moment. But I want even better. The next version will be 2.0.0, and I'll implement in it:

- [LSP](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/overview#language-server-protocol) functionality to improve performance
- a semantic analyzer for the GPPL
- here should be a complete project with a settings file, parsing of all dependent files, deploy functionality and packaging into an archive
- and more ...

## Extension Settings

There are a few settings for this extension:

(File -> Preferenses -> Settins -> Extensions)

- `Editor: Default Formatter`: you must specify _'anzory.vscode-gppl-support'_ to be able to format GPPL documents (by default)
- `Format: Enable`: specifies whether or not the document can be formatted
- `Format: Insert Spaces`: indicates whether or not to replace tabs with spaces
- `Format: Tab Size`: specifies the indent size
- `Files: Encoding`: one of the [common encodings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding#Common_character_encodings)

In addition, the formatting behavior depends on the following settings:

(File -> Preferenses -> Settins -> Text Editor -> Formatting)

- `Format On Save`: defines whether or not the document will be formatted when it is saved
